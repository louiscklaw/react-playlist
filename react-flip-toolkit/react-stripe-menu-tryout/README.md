### Details

This animation demo explores how one might recreate [Stripe's animated menu](https://stripe.com/) in React.

In order to keep the example as simple as possible, it focuses mainly on the animation aspect and therefore is not WAI-ARIA compliant. (Take a look at Stripe's full implementation for what seems to be a fully accessible nav menu component.)

There are multiple ways one could implement this animation, each with its own tradeoffs. This demo is particularly focused on developer ease of use.
